  Full interactive onboarding for remobi — the mobile terminal overlay for tmux.
  Checks prerequisites, inspects tmux config, interviews the user about their
  workflow, generates a validated remobi.config.ts, suggests tmux mobile
  optimisations, and walks through deployment. Use this skill whenever someone
  asks to set up remobi, configure remobi, onboard with remobi, generate a
  remobi config, make tmux mobile-friendly, use remobi with zellij or herdr,
  or deploy remobi with Tailscale. Also use when the user says "onboard me"
  or "set up my phone terminal".

# remobi-setup

Interactive onboarding skill for [remobi](https://github.com/connorads/remobi) — monitor and control tmux (or zellij, herdr) from your phone.

This skill walks the user through setup in one conversation. The guiding principle: **detect everything possible, default everything sensible, ask only what requires human intent.** Most users answer 1-3 questions total.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Welcome and understand (1 question)

Open with a one-liner confirming what they're getting, then ask what brings them here:

> "remobi puts your tmux session on your phone — same panes, same windows, touch controls on top. Everything we set up here you can change later."
>
> "What brings you to remobi? For example: monitoring coding agents from your phone, getting phone access to your dev sessions, or just curious to try it out."

Map the answer to a persona internally (don't tell the user their "persona"):

| Persona | Signals | Downstream effect |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Agent Watcher** | Mentions coding agents, Claude Code, Codex, AI, monitoring | Auto-zoom on, floating zoom button, double-tap zoom enabled, lean config, minimal questions |
| **Remote Dev** | Mentions tmux, SSH, dev workflow, existing setup | Inspect config thoroughly, offer popup drawer buttons, ask about auto-zoom |
| **Newcomer** | Says curious, trying it out, heard about it, no specific use case | Offer tmux setup, explain concepts, auto-zoom on, sensible defaults |

If the answer is ambiguous, lean towards Agent Watcher — it's the most common path and the defaults work well for everyone.

### Phase 2: Environment and tmux setup

#### Check prerequisites

Run silently, then report what's present vs missing:

```bash
node --version          # need >= 22
tmux -V                 # default target multiplexer
which zellij            # alternative multiplexer (see zellij path below)
which herdr             # alternative multiplexer (see herdr path below)
which remobi            # npm install -g remobi
```

If anything is missing, help install it:
- **Node**: suggest mise, nvm, or direct install
- **tmux**: `brew install tmux` or distro package
- **remobi**: `npm install -g remobi`

#### zellij instead of tmux

[zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) is a batteries-included tmux alternative with a discoverable, modal UI. If zellij is installed and the user prefers it (or asks for it), take the zellij path:

```bash
remobi serve -- zellij attach --create main
```

`zellij attach --create <name>` attaches or creates, like `tmux new-session -A`. On the zellij path:

- **Skip the tmux inspection and mouse-mode steps entirely** — zellij enables mouse mode by default, so touch scroll and tap-to-focus work with no multiplexer config
- Stock zellij ships a tmux-compat mode on Ctrl-B (`\x02`): the Prefix drawer button and the `+ Win` (`\x02c`), Split (`\x02%`/`\x02"`), Zoom (`\x02z`), Copy (`\x02[` — scroll mode), and Kill (`\x02x`) buttons work unchanged; swipe gestures (`\x02n`/`\x02p` — next/previous tab) work once enabled (default off)
- Replace the three drawer buttons zellij doesn't bind (`tmux-sessions`, `tmux-windows`, `tmux-help`) — see the [zellij example config](#zellij--modal-tmux-alternative) and [Composing zellij key sequences](#composing-zellij-key-sequences)
- Custom keybindings live in `~/.config/zellij/config.kdl` under `keybinds` — inspect it if present; if it uses `clear-defaults=true` without a `tmux` mode block, the Ctrl-B compat bindings are gone and the drawer needs zellij-native sequences throughout
- For small screens, suggest `default_layout "compact"` and `pane_frames false` in `config.kdl` to reclaim rows from zellij's UI chrome
- If the user also stays attached from their desktop, suggest `mirror_session true` in `config.kdl` so both clients see the same view

Then continue at Phase 3.

#### herdr instead of tmux

[herdr](https://github.com/ogulcancelik/herdr) is an agent multiplexer — a tmux alternative with built-in agent status detection, common among Agent Watchers. If herdr is installed and the user prefers it (or asks for it), take the herdr path:

```bash
remobi serve -- herdr --session main
```

`herdr --session <name>` attaches or creates, like `tmux new-session -A`. On the herdr path:

- **Skip the tmux inspection and mouse-mode steps entirely** — herdr captures mouse input by default, so touch scroll and tap-to-focus work with no multiplexer config
- herdr's default prefix is Ctrl-B (`\x02`), the same as tmux: the Prefix drawer button and the `+ Win` (`\x02c`), Zoom (`\x02z`), Kill (`\x02x`), and Help (`\x02?`) buttons work unchanged; swipe gestures (`\x02n`/`\x02p`) work once enabled (default off)
- Replace the drawer buttons herdr doesn't bind — see the [herdr example config](#herdr--agent-multiplexer) and [Composing herdr key sequences](#composing-herdr-key-sequences)
- herdr has a built-in single-column layout for narrow terminals (`ui.mobile_width_threshold` in herdr's `config.toml`); no status-bar or popup tuning needed
- Custom keybindings live in `~/.config/herdr/config.toml` under `[keys]` — inspect it if present, and translate any remapped prefix or bindings the same way as a custom tmux prefix

Then continue at Phase 3.

#### Inspect tmux

Gather the user's tmux configuration to inform config generation.

```bash
tmux show-options -g prefix                    # prefix key
tmux list-keys                                 # all bindings
tmux show-options -g mouse                     # mouse mode
tmux show-options -g status-left               # status bar
tmux show-options -g status-position            # top or bottom
tmux list-keys | grep display-popup            # popup bindings
```

If tmux isn't running, fall back to reading the config file directly:

```bash
cat ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf 2>/dev/null || cat ~/.tmux.conf 2>/dev/null
```

Auto-detect and note:
- Prefix key and byte (Ctrl-B = `\x02`, Ctrl-A = `\x01`, etc.)
- Custom popup bindings (lazygit, yazi, scratch shell, system monitor, etc.)
- Whether mouse mode is on
- Split bindings (stock `%`/`"` or remapped `|`/`-`)
- Status bar complexity and position
- Plugin manager (tpm, etc.)
- Double-tap zoom gesture (see `references/mobile-panes.md` for pane workflows)

**Detect installed tools** — check for popular tools that work well as tmux popup bindings:

```bash
which lazygit              # Git TUI
which yazi                 # File manager
which btm || which htop    # System monitor
which nvim || which vim    # Editor
```

#### Offer tmux setup (Agent Watcher and Newcomer only)

If no tmux config exists, read `references/tmux-basics.md` and offer to create one. Frame it as a proposal, not a gap:

**Agent Watcher framing:**
> "I'll create a tmux config tuned for monitoring agents — mouse support, status bar at top, and double-tap zoom so you can zoom into any agent pane on your phone. Go ahead?"

**Newcomer framing:**
> "tmux is the terminal multiplexer that remobi sits on top of — it keeps your sessions running even when you disconnect. I'll set up a config with mouse support, sensible defaults, and a help popup to learn the keybindings. Want me to explain what each setting does as I go?"

**Remote Dev:** Skip — they already have a config.

The starter config comes from `references/tmux-basics.md`. For Agent Watchers, include the "Agent watcher starter config" section (zoom indicator, auto-rename, double-tap zoom via remobi config).

For Newcomers with detected tools, also offer popup bindings:
> "I found lazygit and yazi on your system. These work great as tmux popups — one keypress to open a floating window. Want me to add popup bindings for them?"

Only proceed to Phase 3 once the user has a working tmux session.

### Phase 3: Confirm detections and ask what's needed (0-3 questions)

Present a summary of what you found and what you plan to configure. The style is "here's what I'll do" with checkpoints, not an interview.

**Summary format:**
> "Based on your setup, here's what I'll configure:
> - Prefix: Ctrl-B (detected from your tmux config)
> - Auto-zoom on mobile load (pane fills the phone screen)
> - Floating zoom button (one-tap zoom toggle)
> - Default toolbar and drawer buttons
> - [If applicable:] Drawer buttons for lazygit and yazi (matching your popup bindings)"

Then ask **only** questions that can't be detected or defaulted:

#### Questions by persona

**Agent Watcher (0-1 questions):**

If popup bindings or tools were detected:
> "I found [lazygit/yazi/btm] on your system and matching popup bindings. Want drawer buttons for these in remobi so you can trigger them from your phone?"

If nothing special detected: **zero questions** — proceed straight to config generation.

**Remote Dev (1-3 questions):**

Question 1 (if popup bindings or tools detected):
> "I found popup bindings for [list]. Want matching drawer buttons in remobi?"

Question 2 (if multi-pane layout likely):
> "Do you want auto-zoom when you open remobi on your phone? This zooms the current pane to full screen — works well with multi-pane layouts on a small screen."

Question 3 (catch-all):
> "Anything else you want accessible from your phone? Custom tmux bindings, specific tools, anything I missed?"

**Newcomer (0-1 questions):**

If tools were detected and popup bindings were set up in Phase 2:
> "I set up popup bindings for [lazygit/yazi]. Want matching buttons in remobi's command drawer?"

Otherwise: **zero questions** — defaults are great to start with.

Summarise what you've gathered before moving to config generation.

### Phase 4: Generate config and suggest tmux tweaks

#### Generate `remobi.config.ts`

Export a plain config object — only include keys that differ from defaults, omit everything else. **Do not** `import { defineConfig } from 'remobi'` — the CLI calls `defineConfig()` internally so the config just needs a plain object export.

```typescript
export default {
  // Only non-default overrides here
}
```

Place at `~/.config/remobi/remobi.config.ts` (XDG location) unless the user prefers elsewhere.

After writing, validate by starting remobi. remobi auto-discovers config from the current directory first, then `~/.config/remobi/`, so `--config` is only needed when you want to force a specific file:

```bash
remobi serve --port 18765 -- /bin/true
```

A zero exit means the config loaded and the command started cleanly. If the user stored config somewhere custom, validate that path explicitly instead:

```bash
remobi serve --config /path/to/remobi.config.ts --port 18765 -- /bin/true
```

Fix any errors and re-validate until clean.

See [Config reference](#config-reference) below for the full schema, allowed keys, action types, and escape codes.

#### Suggest tmux mobile optimisations (Remote Dev only)

For Remote Dev users who already had a tmux config, offer mobile tweaks as a single confirmation. Read `references/mobile-tmux.md` and `references/mobile-panes.md` for full context.

> "I have a few suggestions to make your tmux more mobile-friendly: [list 2-3 most impactful items]. Want me to add these to your tmux.conf?"

Prioritise by impact, suggest maximum 3:

1. **Double-tap zoom** (if multi-pane user — enable via remobi `gestures.doubleTap`)
2. **Responsive status bar** (if status bar would overflow on phone — see `references/mobile-tmux.md`)
3. **Zoom indicator** (if `#{window_zoomed_flag}` missing from status)

Also check and mention (but don't push):

| Check | Command | Good sign | Suggestion if missing |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| Mouse mode | `tmux show -g mouse` | `on` | `set -g mouse on` |
| Status position | `tmux show -g status-position` | `top` | `set -g status-position top` (keeps status away from remobi toolbar) |
| Popup sizing | `tmux list-keys \| grep display-popup` | Uses `%` dimensions | Replace fixed char sizes with `95%`/`100%` |
| Window renumbering | `tmux show -g renumber-windows` | `on` | `set -g renumber-windows on` |

Suggest snippets only — never modify `tmux.conf` without explicit permission.

**Skip this for Newcomers** — their starter config from Phase 2 already includes the essentials.

### Phase 5: Deploy and wrap up

#### Deployment

Detect what's available and recommend accordingly:

```bash
which tailscale            # check for Tailscale
```

**If Tailscale installed:** recommend Tailscale Serve directly:
> "I see Tailscale on your system. Tailscale Serve is the simplest way to access remobi from your phone — HTTPS over your private network, no extra setup."

Read `references/tailscale-serve.md` for the full guide.

**If no Tailscale:** offer options:
> "To access remobi from your phone, you need to put it behind a trusted network layer. Options:
> - **Tailscale Serve** (recommended) — private VPN, HTTPS, easiest setup
> - **Cloudflare Tunnel + Access** — private tunnel with access policies
> - **Local network** — if your phone is on the same WiFi/VPN"

remobi is a remote-control surface for your terminal — never expose it to the public internet. All deployment options keep access private.

#### Security hardening

remobi hardens the connection even on private networks. Mention these if the user has security concerns:

- **Binds `127.0.0.1` only** — never exposed to network without explicit `--host` flag
- **Content-Security-Policy** — strict default-src, script-src, connect-src scoped to same host
- **WebSocket origin validation** — rejects cross-origin upgrade requests
- **Relay buffer limit** — 1 MB per connection; drops oversized payloads
- **Local-only default** — remobi binds to `127.0.0.1` unless the user explicitly changes `--host`
- **X-Frame-Options DENY** — prevents clickjacking via iframes
- **Referrer-Policy: no-referrer** — no URL leaking to external sites

For macOS users, mention `--no-sleep` and point to `references/keep-awake.md` for persistent options.

For users migrating from old ttyd-based setups, point to `references/ttyd-flags.md` as legacy guidance only.

#### Summary

Tell the user:
1. What was configured and why (prefix byte, custom bindings, gestures, auto-zoom)
2. How to start: `remobi serve`
3. How to access from their phone (URL from deployment choice)
4. PWA install: on mobile, tap "Add to Home Screen" for a standalone app experience
5. Built-in mobile controls (these work out of the box, no config needed):
   - **Font size**: `Font -`/`Font +` buttons in the command drawer (`☰ More`) — tapping them keeps the drawer open for repeat taps, and the adjusted size persists across reloads (localStorage `remobi:fontSize`). Config: `font.mobileSizeDefault` (default 13px), `font.sizeRange` (default [8, 32]), steps by 2
   - **Scroll buttons**: Opt-in floating arrow buttons on the right edge — off by default, enable with `scrollButtons.enabled: true`. Long-press for rapid repeat (300ms delay, 100ms interval). Auto-fade after 2s. Strategy follows `gestures.scroll.strategy` (`wheel` sends mouse events, `keys` sends PageUp/PageDown)
   - **Combo picker**: Modal for arbitrary key combos — type `C-s`, `M-Enter`, `Alt-x`, `C-[`. Supports Ctrl, Alt, Shift modifiers + named keys (PageUp, Escape, etc.). Opened via drawer "Combo" button
   - **Help overlay**: `Guide` button in the command drawer. Shows all configured buttons, gestures, and floating buttons in tables. Config-driven, updates when you change buttons
   - **Landscape + keyboard**: When on-screen keyboard opens in landscape, row 2 auto-hides (except the ⌨ button) and buttons shrink — only if a second row exists; the default single-row toolbar stays fully visible. No config needed
   - **Floating d-pad**: `✥` button on toolbar row1 pops up a six-key arrow cluster (← ↑ ↓ → ⌫ ⏎) above the toolbar — moshi style. Taps send keys without stealing terminal focus or popping the soft keyboard; in `keyboardMode: 'manual'` the input lock stays untouched. No config needed
   - **Keyboard sovereignty**: `mobile.keyboardMode` — `'auto'` (default): tapping the terminal opens the soft keyboard, ⌨ is momentary focus/blur. `'manual'`: the keyboard never pops up on terminal taps — only the ⌨ button (toolbar row1, next to ☰ More) grants/revokes input permission. If a manual-mode config has no ⌨ button anywhere, remobi injects one into row1 so the keyboard stays reachable
   - **Voice composer**: when configured, the toolbar Voice entry opens a second-layer composer without starting ASR or focusing the input. Tap the composer Mic to start/stop, edit the final text, and Send; × or the backdrop discards it. It requires HTTPS (except localhost/127.0.0.1); iOS backgrounding, locking, calls, Siri, or another app interrupting audio cancels the recording.
   - **Image upload**: 🖼 Image button in the command drawer — picks a photo and POSTs it raw to the remobi server (`/api/image-drop`, PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF, 10 MiB max), then inserts the temp file path into the agent input without pressing Enter. Works over plain HTTP — no HTTPS or config needed, the phone only has to reach the server. If the session changed or the insert was not confirmed, the status panel offers Retry insert and Copy path
6. PWA: enabled by default. On mobile Safari/Chrome, tap Share then "Add to Home Screen" for standalone app experience. Config options:
   - `pwa.enabled` (default `true`) — set `false` to disable manifest + icons
   - `pwa.themeColor` (default `'#1e1e2e'`) — status bar colour on mobile
   - `pwa.shortName` (optional) — short name for home screen icon (falls back to `name`)
7. This is a starting point — not a locked-in config. Run this skill again any time to tweak buttons, add drawer commands, or change gestures.

## Config reference

### Allowed root keys

Exactly these — validation rejects anything else:

```
name  theme  font  toolbar  drawer  gestures  mobile  floatingButtons  scrollButtons  pwa  reconnect  asr
```

### ButtonAction union

| `type`           | Required fields     | Notes |
|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| `send`           | `data: string`      | Optional `keyLabel?: string` for help overlay |
| `prefix`         | `data: string`      | Sends prefix byte then opens combo picker for follow-up key. Use `{ type: 'send', data: '\x02' }` for raw prefix-only behaviour |
| `ctrl-modifier`  | (none)              | Opens Ctrl+key combo UI |
| `paste`          | (none)              | Paste from clipboard |
| `combo-picker`   | (none)              | Opens Ctrl/Alt + key modal |
| `drawer-toggle`  | (none)              | Opens/closes command drawer |
| `font-size`      | `delta: number`     | Adjust terminal font size, clamped to `font.sizeRange` |
| `help`           | (none)              | Opens the help overlay |
| `keyboard-toggle` | (none)             | Toggles the soft keyboard. Default on toolbar row1 (next to ☰ More). In `mobile.keyboardMode: 'manual'` it is the only way to summon the keyboard; remobi injects one into row1 if the config has none |
| `dpad-toggle`    | (none)              | Toggles the floating d-pad (← ↑ ↓ → ⌫ ⏎) above the toolbar. Default on toolbar row1 (between ⏎ and ⌨). D-pad taps never steal terminal focus or pop the soft keyboard |
| `voice-input`    | (none)              | Toolbar-only voice-composer entry; its internal Mic uses tap-to-toggle. Drawer/floating placement is rejected by validation. Requires `asr.enabled: true` and a secure context |
| `image-upload`   | (none)              | Uploads an image to the server (`POST /api/image-drop`: raw bytes, PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF sniffed from magic bytes, exact 10 MiB limit, stored as a `0600` temp file) and inserts the temp path into the agent input — never sends Enter. Default in the drawer. No HTTPS or config prerequisite; the phone just needs to reach the remobi server |

Non-`send`/`prefix` actions must NOT have `data` or `keyLabel` — the validator rejects them.

### ControlButton shape

Every button in toolbar rows, drawer, and floatingButtons uses this schema:

```typescript
{
  id: string           // unique within its array
  label: string        // text shown on the button
  description: string  // shown in help overlay — keep user-facing and clear
  action: ButtonAction
}
```

### Button array forms (`toolbar.row1`, `toolbar.row2`, `drawer.buttons`)

Two forms — pick the least invasive:

```typescript
// 1. Replace entirely (plain array)
toolbar: { row1: [{ id, label, description, action }, ...] }

// 2. Transform (function receives defaults, returns new array)
toolbar: { row1: (defaults) => defaults.filter(b => b.id !== 'tab') }

// Function form covers all operations via standard JS:
// - Append:  (d) => [...d, newBtn]
// - Prepend: (d) => [newBtn, ...d]
// - Remove:  (d) => d.filter(b => b.id !== 'q')
// - Replace: (d) => d.map(b => b.id === 'tmux-prefix' ? newBtn : b)
// - Insert:  (d) => { const i = d.findIndex(b => b.id === 'tab'); return [...d.slice(0,i), newBtn, ...d.slice(i)] }
```

`voice-input` buttons may be placed in either toolbar row. They are intentionally not supported in
the drawer or `floatingButtons`; config validation rejects those placements because the voice
composer is a toolbar entry and its Mic control belongs inside the second layer. When `asr.enabled`
is true and neither toolbar row contains `voice-input`, remobi injects the entry after
`keyboard-toggle` and before `drawer-toggle`, or appends it to row1 when neither anchor exists.

### Floating buttons

Must use the grouped shape — a flat `ControlButton[]` is rejected:

```typescript
floatingButtons: [
  {
    position: 'top-left',           // required
    direction: 'row',               // optional: 'row' | 'column' (default 'row')
    buttons: [{ id, label, description, action }],
  },
]
```

Valid positions: `top-left | top-right | top-centre | bottom-left | bottom-right | bottom-centre | centre-left | centre-right`

### Default button IDs

**Toolbar row 1** (7 buttons — the only row by default; moshi-style single row):

| `id` | `label` | `action` |
|------|---------|----------|
| `esc` | Esc | `send` `\x1b` |
| `ctrl-c` | C-c | `send` `\x03` (dedicated — tap twice to quit coding agents) |
| `backspace` | ⌫ | `send` `\x7f` |
| `enter` | enter ⏎ | `send` `\r` |
| `dpad-toggle` | ✥ | `dpad-toggle` (floating d-pad owns the arrow keys) |
| `keyboard-toggle` | keyboard ⌨ | `keyboard-toggle` |
| `drawer-toggle` | hamburger More | `drawer-toggle` |

**Toolbar row 2**: empty by default (single-row toolbar). Set `toolbar.row2` to opt into a second row.

**Drawer** (31 buttons — includes the keys removed from the toolbar: `shift-tab`, `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`, `ctrl-c`, `ctrl-d`, `q`, `alt-enter`, `space`, `backspace`, `ctrl`, `tmux-prefix`, `paste`):

| `id` | `label` | `action` |
|------|---------|----------|
| `tmux-new-window` | + Win | `send` `\x02c` |
| `tmux-split-vertical` | Split \| | `send` `\x02%` |
| `tmux-split-horizontal` | Split -- | `send` `\x02"` |
| `tmux-zoom` | Zoom | `send` `\x02z` |
| `tmux-sessions` | Sessions | `send` `\x02s` |
| `tmux-windows` | Windows | `send` `\x02w` |
| `page-up` | PgUp | `send` `\x1b[5~` |
| `page-down` | PgDn | `send` `\x1b[6~` |
| `tmux-copy` | Copy | `send` `\x02[` |
| `tmux-help` | Help | `send` `\x02?` |
| `tmux-kill-pane` | Kill | `send` `\x02x` |
| `combo-picker` | Combo | `combo-picker` |
| `font-decrease` | Font - | `font-size` `delta: -2` |
| `font-increase` | Font + | `font-size` `delta: 2` |
| `guide` | Guide | `help` |
| `tab` | Tab | `send` `\t` (row1 alumni — ⌫ took its slot) |
| `shift-tab` | S-Tab | `send` `\x1b[Z` |
| `left` | <- | `send` `\x1b[D` |
| `right` | -> | `send` `\x1b[C` |
| `up` | up arrow | `send` `\x1b[A` (row1 alumni — d-pad fallback) |
| `down` | down arrow | `send` `\x1b[B` (row1 alumni — d-pad fallback) |
| `ctrl-c` | C-c | `send` `\x03` |
| `ctrl-d` | C-d | `send` `\x04` |
| `q` | q | `send` `q` |
| `alt-enter` | M-enter | `send` `\x1b\r` |
| `space` | Space | `send` `' '` |
| `backspace` | backspace | `send` `\x7f` |
| `image-upload` | 🖼 Image | `image-upload` (uploads to the server tmp dir, inserts the path into the agent input — no Enter) |

### Gestures

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `gestures.swipe.enabled` | `false` | Off by default — toolbar row owns horizontal swipes; window switching lives in the drawer |
| `gestures.swipe.left` | `'\x02n'` | Next tmux window |
| `gestures.swipe.right` | `'\x02p'` | Previous tmux window |
| `gestures.swipe.threshold` | `80` | Pixels |
| `gestures.swipe.maxDuration` | `400` | Milliseconds |
| `gestures.pinch.enabled` | `false` | |
| `gestures.scroll.enabled` | `true` | |
| `gestures.scroll.strategy` | `'wheel'` | `'wheel'` (recommended) sends SGR mouse wheel sequences — works in vim, less, htop. `'keys'` sends PageUp/PageDown — simpler, works everywhere |
| `gestures.scroll.speedMultiplier` | `1` | Follow-finger ratio: 1 = finger displacement matches content displacement |
| `gestures.scroll.linesPerWheel` | `1` | Terminal lines scrolled per SGR wheel event (herdr: one SGR event = one line) |
| `gestures.scroll.momentum.enabled` | `true` | Inertial fling after finger lift |
| `gestures.scroll.momentum.friction` | `0.95` | Per-frame velocity decay during fling |
| `gestures.scroll.momentum.minVelocity` | `0.02` | Stop fling below this speed (px/ms) |
| `gestures.scroll.maxLinesPerSend` | `24` | Safety cap on lines redeemed per wheel send |
| `gestures.scroll.sendIntervalMs` | `33` | Minimum interval between wheel sends (~30Hz). Waiting only defers send; pending displacement is never dropped. `0` disables throttling. |
| `gestures.doubleTap.enabled` | `false` | Opt-in double-tap gesture on terminal screen |
| `gestures.doubleTap.data` | `'\x02z'` | Data to send on double-tap (default: tmux zoom toggle) |
| `gestures.doubleTap.maxInterval` | `300` | Max milliseconds between taps |

### Scroll buttons

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `scrollButtons.enabled` | `false` | Floating PgUp/PgDn arrows on the right edge. Off by default — finger-drag scroll covers them |

### Mobile

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `mobile.initData` | `null` | Data sent once on mobile load when viewport < `widthThreshold` |
| `mobile.widthThreshold` | `768` | px — phone/tablet breakpoint for `initData` |
| `mobile.keyboardMode` | `'auto'` | `'auto'`: terminal taps open the soft keyboard; ⌨ is momentary focus/blur. `'manual'`: keyboard stays suppressed (`inputmode="none"`); only the ⌨ button toggles input permission |

### Font

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `font.family` | `'JetBrainsMono NFM, monospace'` | CSS font-family |
| `font.cdnUrl` | jsdelivr nerdfont URL | CSS file for web font |
| `font.mobileSizeDefault` | `13` | px, applied on mobile. User adjustments via the drawer Font −/+ buttons persist in localStorage (`remobi:fontSize`) and win over this default |
| `font.sizeRange` | `[8, 32]` | Min/max for the Font −/+ drawer buttons |

### PWA

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `pwa.enabled` | `true` | Set `false` to disable manifest + icons |
| `pwa.themeColor` | `'#1e1e2e'` | Status bar colour on mobile |
| `pwa.shortName` | (none) | Short name for home screen icon, falls back to `name` |

### ASR voice input

ASR is disabled by default. Enable the browser-direct Doubao provider only when the user has
chosen to expose an API key to the browser; keep the key in `remobi.config.local.ts` (never in
the shared config file).

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `asr.enabled` | `false` | Enables microphone permission and the Doubao websocket origin |
| `asr.provider` | `'doubao'` | The only provider in the current release |
| `asr.doubao.apiKey` | `''` | Single query-auth API key; keep it in the `.local` config |
| `asr.doubao.resourceId` | `'volc.seedasr.sauc.duration'` | Volcengine SAUC resource id |
| `asr.autoEnter` | `false` | After confirmed text, sends a separate Enter key; it is not part of text sanitization |

Voice input uses browser-direct provider credentials under a single-user self-hosting trust model.
The API key is embedded in the browser config when enabled, so keep it in the `.local` config and
do not expose an enabled deployment to an untrusted network. Microphone capture is hidden when the
browser is not secure or lacks `getUserMedia`.

The toolbar entry opens the composer but never focuses the ordinary `Speak or type…` input or starts
recording. The composer covers the toolbar with a bottom sheet containing status text, a circular
Mic, Send, and ×. The input is read-only while recording, becomes editable for preview/error, and
successful Send closes the composer; the internal Mic remains tap-to-toggle.

### Hooks (advanced)

Hooks are programmatic, not via `defineConfig()`. See `references/hooks.md` if the user asks about analytics, action filtering, or custom DOM. Do not proactively suggest hooks during setup.

### Escape-code cheat sheet

Use these in `action.data` and gesture `left`/`right` fields:

| Key            | Escape sequence | Notes |
|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Ctrl-B (prefix)| `\x02`          | Default tmux prefix |
| Ctrl-A (prefix)| `\x01`          | screen/byobu/custom prefix |
| Ctrl-C         | `\x03`          | Interrupt |
| Ctrl-D         | `\x04`          | EOF / exit shell |
| Escape         | `\x1b`          | |
| Tab            | `\t`            | |
| Shift+Tab      | `\x1b[Z`        | |
| Enter          | `\r`            | |
| Alt+Enter      | `\x1b\r`        | |
| Backspace      | `\x7f`          | DEL character |
| Up arrow       | `\x1b[A`        | |
| Down arrow     | `\x1b[B`        | |
| Right arrow    | `\x1b[C`        | |
| Left arrow     | `\x1b[D`        | |
| Page Up        | `\x1b[5~`       | |
| Page Down      | `\x1b[6~`       | |
| Space          | `' '`           | literal space |

### Composing tmux key sequences

tmux bindings are `prefix` + `key`. Concatenate the bytes:

```
Ctrl-B + c  ->  '\x02c'   (new window)
Ctrl-B + n  ->  '\x02n'   (next window)
Ctrl-B + p  ->  '\x02p'   (previous window)
Ctrl-B + z  ->  '\x02z'   (zoom pane)
Ctrl-B + %  ->  '\x02%'   (split vertical -- stock tmux)
Ctrl-B + "  ->  '\x02"'   (split horizontal -- stock tmux)
Ctrl-B + [  ->  '\x02['   (copy mode)
Ctrl-B + d  ->  '\x02d'   (detach)
```

For a custom prefix (e.g. Ctrl-A): replace `\x02` with `\x01`.

### Composing zellij key sequences

Stock zellij's tmux-compat mode means `\x02c` / `\x02n` / `\x02p` / `\x02%` / `\x02"` / `\x02z` / `\x02[` / `\x02x` work as in tmux (tabs instead of windows). zellij-native sequences use its modal shortcuts:

```
Ctrl-O + w  ->  '\x0fw'   (session manager)
Ctrl-O + d  ->  '\x0fd'   (detach)
Ctrl-T + n  ->  '\x14n'   (new tab, native tab mode)
Ctrl-P + n  ->  '\x10n'   (new pane, native pane mode)
Ctrl-G      ->  '\x07'    (toggle locked mode — passes Ctrl keys through)
```

Locked mode deserves a button when the user runs TUIs that want Ctrl shortcuts zellij captures.

### Composing herdr key sequences

herdr shares tmux's Ctrl-B prefix, and `\x02c` / `\x02n` / `\x02p` / `\x02z` / `\x02x` / `\x02?` mean the same thing (tabs instead of windows). Bindings that differ from tmux:

```
Ctrl-B + v  ->  '\x02v'   (split side-by-side)
Ctrl-B + -  ->  '\x02-'   (split stacked)
Ctrl-B + w  ->  '\x02w'   (workspace picker)
Ctrl-B + b  ->  '\x02b'   (toggle agent sidebar)
Ctrl-B + e  ->  '\x02e'   (edit scrollback)
Ctrl-B + g  ->  '\x02g'   (goto picker)
Ctrl-B + q  ->  '\x02q'   (detach)
```

## Example configs

### Minimal — default Ctrl-B prefix, custom name only

```typescript
export default {
  name: 'dev',
}
```

### Custom prefix — Ctrl-A (screen/byobu style)

Replace the default `tmux-prefix` button and update swipe gestures:

```typescript
export default {
  name: 'dev',
  toolbar: {
    row1: (defaults) => defaults.map(b =>
      b.id === 'tmux-prefix'
        ? { ...b, description: 'Send tmux prefix key (Ctrl-A)', action: { type: 'prefix', data: '\x01' } }
        : b
    ),
  },
  gestures: {
    swipe: {
      left: '\x01n',
      right: '\x01p',
      leftLabel: 'Next tmux window',
      rightLabel: 'Previous tmux window',
    },
  },
  drawer: {
    buttons: (defaults) => defaults.map(b => {
      // Remap tmux-prefixed buttons from Ctrl-B (\x02) to Ctrl-A (\x01)
      if (b.action.type === 'send' && b.action.data.startsWith('\x02')) {
        return { ...b, action: { ...b.action, data: '\x01' + b.action.data.slice(1) } }
      }
      return b
    }),
  },
}
```

### Agent watcher — auto-zoom + floating button

```typescript
export default {
  name: 'agents',
  mobile: {
    initData: '\x02z',    // zoom focused pane on mobile load
  },
  floatingButtons: [
    {
      position: 'top-left',
      buttons: [
        {
          id: 'zoom',
          label: 'Zoom',
          description: 'Toggle pane zoom',
          action: { type: 'send', data: '\x02z' },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

### zellij — modal tmux alternative

Keeps the tmux-compat defaults, swaps the three unbound buttons for zellij equivalents:

```typescript
export default {
  name: 'zellij',
  drawer: {
    buttons: (defaults) => [
      ...defaults.filter((b) => !['tmux-sessions', 'tmux-windows', 'tmux-help'].includes(b.id)),
      { id: 'zellij-sessions', label: 'Sessions', description: 'Open session manager (Ctrl-O + w)', action: { type: 'send', data: '\x0fw' } },
      { id: 'zellij-lock', label: 'Lock', description: 'Toggle locked mode (Ctrl-G)', action: { type: 'send', data: '\x07' } },
    ],
  },
}
```

Start with `remobi serve -- zellij attach --create main`.

### herdr — agent multiplexer

Keeps the shared-binding defaults, swaps the tmux-only buttons for herdr equivalents:

```typescript
export default {
  name: 'herdr',
  drawer: {
    buttons: (defaults) => [
      ...defaults.filter(
        (b) => !['tmux-split-vertical', 'tmux-split-horizontal', 'tmux-sessions', 'tmux-windows', 'tmux-copy'].includes(b.id),
      ),
      { id: 'herdr-split-v', label: 'Split |', description: 'Split pane side-by-side (prefix + v)', action: { type: 'send', data: '\x02v' } },
      { id: 'herdr-split-h', label: 'Split —', description: 'Split pane stacked (prefix + -)', action: { type: 'send', data: '\x02-' } },
      { id: 'herdr-workspaces', label: 'Spaces', description: 'Open workspace picker (prefix + w)', action: { type: 'send', data: '\x02w' } },
      { id: 'herdr-sidebar', label: 'Sidebar', description: 'Toggle agent sidebar (prefix + b)', action: { type: 'send', data: '\x02b' } },
      { id: 'herdr-scrollback', label: 'Scroll', description: 'Edit scrollback (prefix + e)', action: { type: 'send', data: '\x02e' } },
    ],
  },
}
```

Start with `remobi serve -- herdr --session main`. `tmux-windows` is filtered out because in herdr `prefix+w` opens the workspace picker — `herdr-workspaces` re-adds the same sequence with an accurate label.

### Scroll strategy — keys instead of wheel

```typescript
export default {
  gestures: {
    scroll: { strategy: 'keys' },
  },
}
```

### Popup-heavy workflow — lazygit, yazi, scratch shell

Uses function form to keep default drawer buttons and append popup triggers:

```typescript
export default {
  name: 'dev',
  drawer: {
    buttons: (defaults) => [
      ...defaults,
      {
        id: 'lazygit',
        label: 'Git',
        description: 'Open lazygit popup (prefix + g)',
        action: { type: 'send', data: '\x02g' },
      },
      {
        id: 'yazi',
        label: 'Files',
        description: 'Open yazi file manager popup (prefix + y)',
        action: { type: 'send', data: '\x02y' },
      },
      {
        id: 'scratch',
        label: 'Scratch',
        description: 'Open scratch shell popup (prefix + `)',
        action: { type: 'send', data: '\x02`' },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

Requires matching tmux bindings (see `references/tmux-basics.md` popup section).

## Guardrails

- **Do not `import` from `'remobi'`** — the CLI calls `defineConfig()` internally, so configs just export a plain object. Using `import { defineConfig } from 'remobi'` fails when the config lives outside a project with remobi installed.
- **Never invent root keys.** The validator rejects unknown keys with a path-based error.
- **Use `drawer.buttons`, never `drawer.commands`** — the latter was renamed and no longer works.
- **`send` actions require `data`** — omitting it fails validation.
- **Non-`send` actions must not have `data` or `keyLabel`** — validator rejects them.
- **`floatingButtons` is an array of groups** — wrap buttons in `{ position, buttons }`.
- **`toolbar` has `row1` and `row2`** — there is no `row3` or flat `buttons` key on toolbar.
- **`mobile.initData`** is `string | null` — set to `null` to disable, not `false` or `''`.
- **`reconnect`** has only `enabled: boolean` — defaults to `true`. Set `{ enabled: false }` to disable.
- **`gestures.scroll` is an object, not a string** — use `{ strategy: 'wheel' }` or `{ strategy: 'keys' }`, never a bare `'wheel'` / `'keys'` string.

## Validation

```bash
remobi serve --port 18765 -- /bin/true
```

A zero exit means the config is valid when the file is in the normal search path (current directory or `~/.config/remobi/`).

For a custom location, validate explicitly:

```bash
remobi serve --config /path/to/remobi.config.ts --port 18765 -- /bin/true
```

Any error output means fix the reported paths before proceeding.

### Common validation errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `config.<unknown-key>` | Invented or legacy root key | Remove it; only allowed root keys are valid |
| `config.drawer.commands` | Old key name | Rename to `drawer.buttons` |
| `config.toolbar.buttons` | Wrong toolbar shape | Use `toolbar.row1` and/or `toolbar.row2` |
| `action.type: expected 'send' \| ...` | Wrong type string | Use exact literal from ButtonAction union |
| `action.data: expected string, received undefined` | `send` action missing `data` | Add `data: '\x...'` |
| `action.data: expected undefined` | `data` on non-`send` action | Remove `data` from non-`send` actions |
| `floatingButtons[0]: expected object` | Flat `ControlButton[]` | Wrap in group: `{ position: 'top-left', buttons: [...] }` |
| `mobile.initData: expected string or null` | `false` or `0` passed | Use `null` to disable, or a string to send |
| `Cannot find package 'remobi'` | Config uses `import ... from 'remobi'` | Remove the import — export a plain object instead. The CLI calls `defineConfig()` internally |
| `gestures.scroll: expected Object, received string` | Bare `'wheel'` / `'keys'` string | Use `{ strategy: 'wheel' }` or `{ strategy: 'keys' }` |
